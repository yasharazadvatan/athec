# Athec

A Python package for computational aesthetic analysis of visual media

Athec is a Python library that measures a variety of aesthetic attributes, such as brightness, contrast, colorfulness, color variety, percentages of different colors, visual complexity, and depth of field. Computationally calculated visual attributes have been demonstrated to predict a wide range of outcomes, such as images' aesthetic appeal, popularity on social media, and interestingness.
