    Resize an image while keeping its original aspect ratio.
    Return:
    (1) the file size, width, height of the original image
    (2) the file size, width, height of the resized image.
    Parameters:
    img_path: str. The file path to the original image.
    resize_path: str. The file path where the resized image will be saved.
    max_w (optional, default -99): int. If this variable is larger than 0, the image will be resized so that its width does not exceed max_w.
    max_h (optional, default -99): int. If this variable is larger than 0, the image will be resized so that its height does not exceed max_h.
    max_side (optional, default -99): int. If this variable is larger than 0, the image will be resized so that its width and height do not exceed max_side.
    max_size (optional, default -99): int. If this variable is larger than 0, the image will be resized so its size does not exceed max_size.
