    Calculate line dynamics based on edge map.
    Return:

    (1) the number of horizontal lines and summary statistics of their lengths.
    (1) the number of vertical lines and summary statistics of their lengths.
    (1) the number of slanting lines and summary statistics of their lengths.

    return_summary (optional, default False): bool. Whether summary statistics will be returned.
    horizontal_degree (optional, default 10): int. Lines with orientations between -horizontal_degree and horizontal_degree will be categorized as horizontal lines.
    vertical_degree (optional, default 80): int. Lines with orientations smaller than -vertical_degree or larger than vertical_degree will be categorized as vertical lines.
